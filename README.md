LifeAlexa

This skill is designed for senior citizens who can still live without assistance but still run the risk of injury in their homes. The user specifies an emergency contact for the app to contact in the event of its invocation. This way, no matter what the situation, as long as your Alexa connected device can hear you someone will know and be able to get help.
